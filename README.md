**Minesweeper** is a popular puzzle video game that has been around since the early 1990s. It is a single-player game that typically comes pre-installed on many Windows operating systems.

The player can use logic and deduction to determine the locations of the mines based on the numbers revealed. By carefully analyzing the numbers, the player can mark the tiles suspected to contain mines with flags to avoid accidentally detonating them.

However, if the player uncovers a tile containing a mine, the game ends, and the player loses. The player's goal is to successfully uncover all the safe tiles without detonating any mines.

Minesweeper offers different difficulty levels, typically defined by the size of the grid and the number of mines hidden within it.

## How to play?
As you run the Minesweeper.cpp file. You will be presented 3 difficulty options. Press 1 to play easy level.
The game will present you with a rectangular grid of tiles. Each tile represents a hidden cell in the minefield.

Start by pressing the row and column of any tile to reveal what's underneath. The tile will either display a number or a mine.
If the tile shows a number, it indicates the number of mines adjacent to that tile.
If the title shows 0, it indicates empty space. This means there are no mines in the neighboring tiles. In this case, adjacent tiles will also be automatically revealed.
If the tile contains a mine, you lose the game.

Use the information provided by the revealed tiles to deduce the locations of the mines. The numbers on the tiles indicate how many mines are adjacent to them. By analyzing the numbers and their positions, you can make educated guesses about which tiles are safe to choose. Continue revealing tiles until you have cleared all the safe tiles on the grid.

If you uncover all the safe tiles without detonating any mines, you win the game!

If you accidentally click on a tile that contains a mine, the game ends, and you lose. At this point, you can start a new game and try again.

The game offers different difficulty levels, allowing you to choose the size of the grid and the number of mines hidden within it. Beginners often start with smaller grids and fewer mines to get familiar with the gameplay.
Remember, Minesweeper requires careful deduction and logical reasoning. Take your time, analyze the numbers, and make strategic moves to successfully clear the minefield.
